## Tool Selection Guidelines

**When to add optional tools**:
1. You've validated core product-market fit
2. Specific pain point that core stack can't solve
3. Tool saves significant time or enables critical feature
4. Budget allows ($10-50/month per tool)

**When NOT to add optional tools**:
1. Still in MVP/validation phase
2. "Nice to have" features
3. Can be solved with existing stack
4. Adds complexity without clear ROI

**Cost optimization**:
- Start with free tiers
- Upgrade only when hitting limits
- Consolidate where possible (one tool for multiple needs)
- Track ROI: time saved vs. cost
