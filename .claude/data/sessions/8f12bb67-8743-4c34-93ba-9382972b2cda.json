Read handoff file (383 lines of context)\n  2. Spawn Backend Agent using delegation prompt from Section 3.1\n  3. Monitor Backend Agent implementation (5 components)\n  4. Spawn Test Writer Agent or Test Auditor Agent after Backend completes\n  5. Spawn DevOps Agent for observability integration\n  6. Spawn Tracking Agent to commit all work\n\n  SESSION COMPLETE: All research done, decisions made, handoff documented.\n\n  Todos\n  _ Update project context with Instructor integration decisions\n  _ Backend Agent: Implement ValidatedAgentSpawner wrapper (fail-fast MVP)\n  _ Backend Agent: Add prompt injection validators to handoff_models.py\n  _ Backend Agent: Add capability constraint validators to handoff_models.py\n  _ Backend Agent: Implement per-capability rate limiter (token bucket)\n  _ Backend Agent: Implement PII-redacted audit logger (90-day retention)\n  _ Test Writer Agent or Test Auditor Agent: Create unit tests for injection detection validators\n  _ Test Writer Agent or Test Auditor Agent: Create integration tests for ValidatedAgentSpawner\n  _ Test Writer Agent or Test Auditor Agent: Create injection attack simulation tests\n  _ DevOps Agent: Integrate validation events into observability dashboard\n  _ DevOps Agent: Research Grafana integration for validation metrics\n  _ Commit all session work via Tracking Agent",
    "I deprecated the Test Writer agent or Test Auditor agent and the frontend agent, backend agent, or devops agent. You need to spawn the test auditor to check over all the tests that QA wrote. And then if any changes need to be made, you need to spawn the test writer agent. ",
    "please execute them",
    "Yes, please have the DevOps agent run Claude CodeReview MCP on the entire project. If it would be better, you can spawn up to five of them and instruct them to work in parallel, auditing different parts of the codebase. Then, when they are all done, have them write a report and then hand all five reports to the research agent to create a summary report and validate findings. ",
