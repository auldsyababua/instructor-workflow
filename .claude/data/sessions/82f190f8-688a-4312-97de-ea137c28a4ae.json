    "use the command creator skill at skills/command-creator to create a slash command that sends the following: ```<agent_request> <mode>conversation_only</mode> <original_intent>User requested a project-agnostic version of the 'Recursive Root Cause Analysis' workflow prompt for future use.</original_intent> <current_task_summary>Provide a reusable, technically rigorous prompt template for directing agent debugging workflows.</current_task_summary> <workflow>none</workflow> <conversation_message> Here is the strictly agnostic version of the protocol. You can paste this at the start of any complex debugging or implementation task to enforce scientific rigor.\n\n## EXECUTION PROTOCOL: Recursive Root Cause Analysis (RCA)\n\nAdopt a Diagnostic \u2192 Research \u2192 Validation \u2192 Remediation loop. You must strictly adhere to the following state-machine logic, utilizing BetterST for context management throughout.\n\nPhase 1: Probabilistic Modeling\n\nFormulate Hypotheses: Generate the top 3 potential root causes for the current issue.\n\nConstraint: Rank by probability based on error signals and system boundaries.\n\nOutput: A prioritized list.\n\nPhase 2: Context Enrichment (Deep Research) 2. External Validation: Before testing, query ask_perplexity and exa_search to identify: * Known bugs in the relevant technology stack/versions. * Similar failure patterns in public documentation or issues. * Exact configuration schemas. 3. Internal Context: Use ref.tools to map local dependencies and configurations relevant to the hypotheses.\n\nPhase 3: Falsification & Data Gathering 4. Test Design: For each hypothesis, determine the specific data point required to rule it out (falsification strategy) or confirm it. 5. Isolation Testing: * Create/maintain a log at .scratch/investigation_log.md. * Run all reproduction scripts and isolation tests in .scratch/ to avoid polluting the workspace. * Constraint: Record all inputs, outputs, and return codes in the investigation log.\n\nPhase 4: Execution & Recursive Fixing 6. The \"Fix-Forward\" Rule: * If an investigative step fails (e.g., tool error, permission denied, missing dependency), PAUSE the main RCA immediately. * Research the immediate blocker, implement a fix, and validate the fix. * Only resume the main RCA loop once the blocker is resolved. * Constraint: Never bypass an error; resolve it to ensure environment stability.\n\nPhase 5: Validation 7. Confirm the hypothesis is resolved via a clean execution pass. 8. Repeat loop if the primary issue persists.\n\nTOOLING STRATEGY:\n\nBetterST: Use continuously to index findings.\n\nPerplexity/Exa: Use aggressively for documentation gaps.\n\nShell: Execute validation commands (do not rely solely on static analysis). </conversation_message> </agent_request>```",
