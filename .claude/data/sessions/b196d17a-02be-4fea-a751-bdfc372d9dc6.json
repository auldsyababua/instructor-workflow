    "Handoff created: docs/.scratch/handoff-next-planning-agent.md\n\n  Contents:\n  - Complete session achievements (observability deployed, parallel spawning validated)\n  - Instructor JSON enforcement discussion (Section 3: analysis, recommendations, questions for you)\n  - Remaining work (documentation, project context update, commit)\n  - Quick reference (AgentSpawner API, dashboard access, Docker commands)\n  - Decision points (instructor integration, deployment strategy, production limits)\n\n  Key Section for Your Review - Instructor Validation (Section 3):\n\n  My Recommendation: Start without Instructor validation since:\n  - AgentSpawner uses direct Python API (type-safe via Python hints)\n  - No JSON handoff files involved (less to validate)\n  - Observability dashboard provides real-time monitoring (replaces manual validation)\n\n  Discussion Points Added:\n  1. Do we expect untrusted/dynamic delegation requests? (If yes _ Instructor valuable)\n  2. How should failures be handled? (Immediate fail vs auto-retry)\n  3. Should agent capabilities be validated? (e.g., \"QA can't spawn Backend\")\n  4. Is schema documentation worth the complexity? (Pydantic auto-generates JSON schema)\n\n  Next Planning Agent will see this handoff and initiate discussion with you about whether to proceed with Instructor integration or keep current simpler approach.",
    "Do you expect Planning Agent to receive untrusted or dynamic delegation requests? I am the only one using these agents however, they use MCPs to gather info from the internet, especially forums, so someone could implant a context injection attack as a forum comment the LLM reads. And I would probably not know unless the LLM told me. I know there are guards for this, but thats another battle really. \n\nYour preference? Fail-fast or graceful degradation? Both are fine, but backoff is better obviously. Just need to see if its worth all the extra overhead.\n\nShould agent capabilities be validated programmatically? ideally yes. We want to enforce guardrails where we can\n\nYour documentation preference? Auto-generated schemas or manual maintenance? autogenerated is more deterministic and therefore better",
    "Can we create a research plan first? Can you have the research agent please look into the most maintainable, best practice, performant way to integrate this into our planned framework? ",
    "Per-capability (recommended) - Frontend gets 10/min, Backend gets 10/min (separate buckets)\nValidation Failure Escalation - For MVP fail fast, but document future addition after MVP functional. Leave code comments in relevant code as well for future plans\nPII Redaction in Audit Logs\nObservability Dashboard Integration - we should add validation metrics, but keep in mind that grafana is running on teh workhorse so we could use that too.
