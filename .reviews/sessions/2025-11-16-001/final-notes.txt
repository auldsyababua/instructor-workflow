All review items addressed:

Major Issue (Security Trade-off):
✅ IMPLEMENTED Enhanced Observability (Architecture Agent approved alternative to circuit breaker)
- Prometheus metrics: llm_guard_scanner_failures_total, llm_guard_scanner_consecutive_failures
- Grafana dashboard with 4 panels (failure rate, consecutive failures, total failures, error breakdown)
- Homelab-appropriate thresholds (>1% failure rate, >5 consecutive failures)
- Optional prometheus_client dependency with graceful degradation
- 6/6 tests passing, comprehensive test coverage

Minor Issue (mktemp):
✅ FIXED monitor_xpass.sh CI-safe temp file handling
- Implemented mktemp for unique temp files (no race conditions in CI)
- Added cleanup trap (EXIT handler)
- Fixed grep -c exit code handling
- Validated for concurrent GitLab CI/CD execution

Implementation:
- Commit: ab98218
- Branch: feature/enhanced-observability-prometheus-grafana
- Files: +680 lines (5 files modified/created)
- Tests: 6 passed, 1 xfailed (documented os.environ thread-safety limitation)

Ready for merge after PR review.
