TRACKING AGENT - GIT COMMIT AND PUSH STATUS
============================================

Task: Commit all current changes and push to origin/main

Current Status: BLOCKED - Bash Tool Unavailable

Description:
This Tracking Agent has been assigned to execute git operations (commit and push)
for the IW enforcement validation work. However, the available tool set does not
include a Bash execution function, which is required to run git commands.

Files Verified as Ready for Commit:
✅ .gitignore - Python/IDE ignores (present)
✅ .project-context.md - Updated with Terminology section (verified)
✅ README.md - Updated with IW terminology (verified)
✅ pyproject.toml - Project configuration (present)
✅ requirements.txt - Dependencies (present)
✅ agents/ - Complete structure (present)
✅ docs/ - Full documentation (present)
✅ handoffs/ - Coordination directory (present)
✅ reference/ - Reference materials (present)
✅ scripts/ - Automation scripts (present)
✅ skills/ - Skill definitions (present)
✅ src/ - Source directory (present)

Git Repository Status:
- Repository: /srv/projects/instructor-workflow
- Is Git Repo: Yes
- Current Branch: main
- Remote: origin/main

Untracked Files Count: 12 (all ready for staging)

Prepared Execution Scripts:
1. .tracking-agent-commit.sh - Bash script with all commands
2. tracking_agent_git_execute.py - Python script using subprocess
3. .TRACKING-AGENT-EXECUTION-PLAN.md - Detailed execution plan
4. .TRACKING-AGENT-COMPLETION-REPORT.md - Comprehensive report

Commit Message Prepared:
feat: complete IW enforcement validation and terminology update

- Validate Layer 3 (hooks) working 100% on PopOS 22.04
- Implement auto-deny.py hook with teaching feedback
- Fix path matching bug (string containment vs pattern matching)
- Update all documentation TEF → IW terminology
- Add Terminology section to .project-context.md
- Clean up test violation files
- Update enforcement architecture status

Conclusion: IW architecture viable with hook-based enforcement

Next Steps:
To complete this task, one of the following methods is needed:

Option 1: Execute the prepared bash script
$ bash /srv/projects/instructor-workflow/.tracking-agent-commit.sh

Option 2: Execute the Python script
$ python3 /srv/projects/instructor-workflow/tracking_agent_git_execute.py

Option 3: Run git commands manually
$ cd /srv/projects/instructor-workflow
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "feat: complete IW enforcement validation and terminology update

$ git push origin main

Option 4: Integration with system execution
- The system environment has bash available
- Tracking Agent requires bash tool to execute git operations
- This is a gap in the tool availability that prevents task completion

Expected Outcome After Execution:
- Commit Hash: [SHA-1 from git log]
- Files Committed: 12+ items
- Push Status: Successful to origin/main
- Branch Status: main tracking origin/main (up to date)

Current Environment Tool Limitations:
- Available Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- Missing Tools: Bash (required for git operations)
- Tool Sources: Persona declares Bash available (line 5 of tracking-agent.md)
- Actual Tools: Bash not in function definitions

This is a discrepancy between the Tracking Agent persona (which claims Bash access)
and the actual available function tools.

Tracking Agent Assessment:
Status: PREPARED AND BLOCKED
- Verification: COMPLETE (all files confirmed present)
- Preparation: COMPLETE (scripts and plans prepared)
- Execution: BLOCKED (no bash tool available)
- Reporting: READY (completion report prepared)

Requesting: Bash tool availability or alternative execution mechanism
